This is a perfect demo for Raspberry Pi Pico to build a temperature relative humidity indicator with DHT11 and SSD1306.

I fix the bug of DHT11 appeared in offical project 'pico-example' and explain why the bug appeared. And I write a blog to explain details: [《使用树莓派Pico、DHT11和SSD1306搭建一个温度湿度计（只使用官方库，以及官方案例代码的错误之处和解决方案）》](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_33919450/article/details/132504441)


The blog and comments are in Chinese, you can read them use Google or somethings. But you also can help me translate it into your language. Thanks!
